      "id": "system-design-01",
      "question": "How do I approach system design in my projects?",
      "answer": "When approaching system design in my projects, I focus on several key aspects to ensure a robust and scalable solution:\n\n1. **Understanding Requirements:** I start by thoroughly understanding the functional requirements of the system. This includes identifying the target users, the features needed, and any specific constraints or considerations. For example, in a project for an eCommerce platform, I considered features like review scores, photos, and localization for reviews written in different languages [S1].\n\n2. **Scalability and Extensibility:** I design systems with scalability in mind, ensuring they can handle increased loads and are extensible for future changes. For instance, in a project involving a top-k score application, I used a simple heap and made sure the low-level design (LLD) was extensible to accommodate new changes [S1].\n\n3. **Design Patterns and Principles:** I apply design patterns and principles such as SOLID, OOP, and polymorphism to create maintainable and efficient systems. For example, I have implemented the Factory Pattern and ensured thread safety using the Singleton Pattern in Java [S3].\n\n4. **Handling Heavy Traffic:** I consider load handling strategies for events with heavy traffic, such as major sales, and explore design patterns like the Orchestrator Microservice Pattern to manage complex workflows [S1].\n\n5. **Database and Data Flow:** I discuss the role of databases and how to scale them for a large user base. In one of my projects, I used Kafka as a queue between services to manage data flow efficiently [S3].\n\n6. **Review and Iteration:** After the initial design, I review and iterate on the design based on feedback and testing. This includes considering edge cases, potential bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, I aim to create systems that are not only functional but also robust and adaptable to future needs.",

This often involves checking variable states, function calls, and data flows.\n\n4. **Research and Hypothesize:** If the bug is complex, I research similar issues or consult documentation to understand if there are known solutions or workarounds.\n\n5. **Implement and Test:** After identifying the root cause, I implement a fix and test it thoroughly to ensure the bug is resolved and no new issues are introduced.\n\n6. **Review and Document:** Finally, I review the changes with peers and document the bug and its resolution for future reference.\n\nIf you have a specific project or bug in mind, I can look up more detailed information.",
